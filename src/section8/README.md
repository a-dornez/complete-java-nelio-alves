# Section 8 - OOP Introduction

### Object Oriented Programming has three basic concepts

In this chapter you'll be presented and required to apply three basic concepts from OOP, swicthing the way you code from classical structred programming to object oriented programming. Those concepts are:

- **Classes**: in classical structered program, the charateristics of a thing would be stored in separed variables, created one by one. If there multiple cases of the same type of thing, we'll nedd to create other set of variables for each one of them. By creating Classes, we define base models for certain elements. That way, stead of replicating code to represent another occurence of an element, we use said base model to declare and create that occurence. They are like recipes or blueprints for objects.

- **Attributes**: those are the propoerties that an class has. They identify and receive data of essential characteristics that define an object.

- **Methods**: they are like functions from structured prgramming, but implemented in OOP. Operations that are often made can be done by functions, so instead of writing every single line line of code every sinmgle time we need it in a program, we can write the whole process a single time, give it a name and when we need to execute it, we just call it by it's name to perform the operation it was designed for.
