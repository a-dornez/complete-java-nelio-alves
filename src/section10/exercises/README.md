A hostel owner has ten rooms to rent for students. Those rooms are indentified by numbers  from 0 to 9.

Make a program that starts with 10 empty rooms and then read an 'N' quantity representing the   number that will rent rooms (N can be from 1 to 10). Then, register the rent of the N students.
For each rent register, inform name, email aswell which room as chosen (0 to 9). Suppose that  a vacant room is chosen. 

Finally, your program should print a report of all occupied hostel rooms, sorting them by room number.
