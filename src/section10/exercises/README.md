## [üè® Hostel Room Rent Register](./application/HostelTenantRegister.java)

### Exercise prompt
A hostel owner has ten rooms to rent for students. Those rooms are indentified by numbers  from 0 to 9.

Make a program that starts with 10 empty rooms and then read an 'N' quantity representing the   number that will rent rooms (N can be from 1 to 10). Then, register the rent of the N students.
For each rent register, inform name, email aswell which room as chosen (0 to 9). Suppose that  a vacant room is chosen. 

Finally, your program should print a report of all occupied hostel rooms, sorting them by room number.

## üìä Employee Manager

### Exercise prompt

Write a program that reads an integer number 'N' and then reads data (id, name and salary) of a 'N' amount of employees. Id values must not be repeated.

Then, apply an x per cent raise on a given employee salary. To perform this, the program must read an id and x value. If inserted Id does not exist, print a message and abort operation. Finally, print an updated employees list.

Remember to apply encapsulation, to prevent salary values from being arbitrarily modified. A salary should be only increased by a raise operation based on a percentage.
